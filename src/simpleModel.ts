// Test creating direct constraint classes like the templates
import React from 'react';
import { makeCustomResourceClass } from '@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/lib/lib/k8s/crd';

// Remove K8sAllowedReposClass and K8sContainerLimitsClass
// as they are hardcoded and will be replaced by dynamic discovery.

// The SimpleConstraintClass is also removed as it depends on the hardcoded classes.
// All functionality will be handled by the dynamic ConstraintClass in model.ts.

// Ensure that all usages of K8sAllowedReposClass, K8sContainerLimitsClass,
// and SimpleConstraintClass are removed from other files and replaced with
// dynamic alternatives using ConstraintClass from model.ts.
